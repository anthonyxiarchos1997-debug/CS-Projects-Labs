# CS-Projects-Labs

Sandbox for tracking computer-science labs and personal practice projects.

## Structure
- `Labs/`: coursework-style exercises and lab notes.
- `Projects/`: longer-form experiments or prototypes spun off from lab work.

### Current Highlight
- [`Projects/network_scanner`](Projects/network_scanner): Python (`python-nmap`) utility that discovers hosts on a CIDR block and optionally enumerates open ports. Requirements and usage examples live in that folder’s README; quick start:

- [`Projects/packet_sniffer`](Projects/packet_sniffer): Scapy-based CLI to capture packets with optional BPF filtering, tabular/JSON reports, and `.pcap` export for Wireshark.
- [`Projects/PasswordTool`](Projects/PasswordTool): CLI tool to check password strength (entropy, complexity) and generate secure random passwords. Includes detailed feedback and scoring.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonyxiarchos1997-debug/CS-Projects-Labs.git
cd CS-Projects-Labs
```
Create subfolders under `Labs/` or `Projects/` as you add new work, then commit and push normally.
